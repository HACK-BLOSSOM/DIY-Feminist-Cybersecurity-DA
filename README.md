https://hackblossom.org/cybersecurity/

(This is a work-in-progress to translate <a href="https://github.com/HACK-BLOSSOM/DIY-Feminist-Cybersecurity">A DIY Guide to Feminist Cybersecurity</a> into danish. Eventually, this readme will be translated into danish!)

This is a comprehensive, succinct, and accessible DIY cybersecurity guide geared towards feminists, activists, and their friends. If you would like to contribute, please contact <a href="mailto:noah@hackblossom.org" target="_top">noah@hackblossom.org</a>.

### Installation
The guide is built using the static site generator, Jekyll. Unfortunately, our guide is a relic of simpler times, so we're stuck on an older version of Jekyll for the time-being! Specifically, version 2.5.3. The following steps will get you up and running with a local version of the guide on your machine. Note that these steps are for OS X El Capitan; Windows and Linux users, adjust accordingly!

```
// Make sure you installed jekyll's requirements: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
$ git clone https://github.com/noahke/DIY-Feminist-Cybersecurity.git
$ gem install jekyll -v '2.5.3' -n /usr/local/bin
$ jekyll serve -w
// The guide is ~alive~ at http://0.0.0.0:4000/
```

Your casual internet browsing yields a treasure trove of personal data for anyone who can see what you’re doing. Websites often track your activity across the internet so they can collect marketing data: demographics, what your interests are, where you spend your time, and so on. As you can imagine, if this data is valuable to companies, it’s valuable to hackers and trolls too; it’s very easy to capture sensitive information like credit card data, physical location, or account data just by being able to monitor someone’s web browsing. So what do you need to know to fight these jerks?

If your internet activity is not encrypted, it is NOT private and you should assume that someone or something could see it.

As you browse the web, think of it as constantly sending a multitude of open letters: anyone that positions themselves correctly can simply read them before passing them on to their intended destination. They can know where it came from, where it’s going, and everything contained within. This is where encryption is handy: encryption is like sealing the letters in envelopes, guaranteeing that only the desired recipient can read the letters’ contents. And thanks to a lot of ingenious technologies, we can obscure the information about the sender and recipient as well.

Left unchecked, your cookies will feed personal data to private companies.

Cookies are an integral part of browsing the web: small pieces of data are stored on your computer by websites to keep track of persistent data such as whether you’re logged in or what your user preferences may be. However, it has become very popular for websites to not only store data about your user experience, but also track data about you. These cookies (as well as their ugly cousins like LFOs that perform similar functions) are especially valued by marketing companies that build intimate profiles of your personal information and web habits to be mined and sold for advertising purposes. Often accumulating for months and even years, malicious cookies can expose vast amounts of personal information about you that companies should not have. This data’s existence and dissemination without your knowledge means it’s very possible for your data to fall into malicious hands be it by hacking, leaking, or just invasive advertising.

Public wifi is so very, very insecure.

When you are on a wifi network, anyone else using that network can watch your web traffic (even if it’s a password-protected network). Because there can be so many people using the same network (like at a coffee shop or library), a malicious hacker could very easily collect tons of personal information about everyone on the network. They could intercept your traffic and feed you fake websites in order to get valuable data from you! And even if you’re not using a network intentionally, just leaving your phone with wifi-enabled means nearby networks can tap into your phone and pull metadata about you without your ever trying to use their internet. To fight this invasive snooping, you have to ensure that your web traffic is encrypted: using the Tor Browser and/or a VPN network as detailed below will give you great privacy. You should also disable wifi on your phone whenever you explicitly don’t need it!

The goal of the section is to make your internet activity secure from nonconsensual tracking and monitoring, effectively making you anonymous (though you are never -truly- anonymous; you have an IP address and an Internet Provider after all). The amount of protection you adopt is totally up to you: usually the trade-off is the more protection you want, the slower and more inconvenient browsing on the web can be. Fortunately, many of the basic technologies outlined require zero effort on your part and still offer a ton of protection.
